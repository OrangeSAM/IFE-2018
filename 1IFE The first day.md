4.26，任务已在两天前开始了。

对如何实现git pages预览有了个基本的了解.
what the problem this function want to solve is how to preview a finished code.
so you need to open and config this function,then youll get a url,till here, we are almost finished it.
just need to put the file which we want to preview behind the url we just got.
But it was not convient enough for you to preview every file.
so maybe you can add a file which contains all of you file preview url.

How make it simple enough to preview each file is the problem need to be solved.

That is all for today.
